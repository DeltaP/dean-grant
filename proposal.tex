  \section*{Summary}
  Lattice gauge theory is an extremely computationally demanding problem.  As a communty we take pride in making the best possible use of available computational resources.  One emerging resource that I am eager to break into is Graphics Processing Units (GPU's).   My proposal is to build a workstation around two of NVIDIA's latest Graphics Processing Units (GPU) the Kepler K20.  This workstation will help support the thesis reserach of myself as well as another graduate student, Gregory Petropoulos.  To accomplish our goal we are requesting \$10,000.  We are both studying

  \section*{Code Development aka Coding for the Future}
  There is a pardigm shift occuring in high performance computing toward programming on GPU's.  
  Many large clusters of GPU's have been built as well as hybrid machines such as Titan.  
  Our group currently does not have any GPU compatible code nor do we have the local resources needed for code development.  
  The machine proposed in this grant would fill this gap and allow us to participate in GPU code deveolopment.  
  
  \section*{Its all about the Flops}
  When not being used for code development the machine will serve as a dedicated computational resource.  
  The machine that I propose has two six core processors and two Keperl GPU's and can provide a theoretical peak of 2.5 Teraflops (trillion floating point operations per second).  
  As a dedicated resource that we have access to this is
